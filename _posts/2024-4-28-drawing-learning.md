I was talking with a very artistic uni friend, and I asked him how he is able to draw so well.

He told me all he did was a bunch of sketches over a few years, and that's it. No feedback, nothing.

This took me immediately to the example of training an LLM. You start with a very large corpora of information, and train a base model in an unsupervised manner, then finetune it with model query, answer pairs (feedback from a teacher/peer).

This has encouraged me to learn drawing by keeping a sketchbook and doing a bunch of sketches every day.
